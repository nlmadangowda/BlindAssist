list of included features.
1. object detection.
2. image to text to speach.
3. Obltacle Detection.
4. Walking Assist.

List of Components.
1. Raspberry Pi Zerp 2 W: bcz of its small form factor and huge processing power.
2. Raspberry Pi Camera module: for Image capturing.
3. Wired Ear Phone/Speaker (any): for Voice Assistance.
4. Vibration Motor (no Specific Part name yet): for notifing the user.
5. HC-SR0 UltraSonic sensor: for Obltacle Detection.
6. Battery(No Specific Part name yet): To power the Raspberry Pi.

Efficiency: Cant be determined at the design stage. and mostly it depnds on the API.

Algorithm: Not Sure about the name, used by google in the backend, need to do some resarch.

Latency: Since the Processing is not done on board, the captured image is analysed using Google Vision API in cloud,
it depends on the network availblity and strength. 

Methodology:
Step 1: Raspberry Pi board set up (OS flashing)
Step 2: Installing the dependecies (Vission API)
Step 3: Integrating the Input Devices (Camera & HC-SR0)
Step 4: Integrating the Output Devices (Speaker)
Step 5: Collecting the samples from the sensor devices(Camera & HC-SR0), with a fixed time (500ms to 2s)
Step 6: Analysing the data and taking required action.
